# References

Place reference PDFs provided with the contest materials in this folder so teammates can find them quickly.

Currently available:
- `DYAMOND_PHASEII_1km_Atmosphere_FileSpec_97bntaf_UxOsALQ.pdf` (DYAMOND GEOS file layout and variable notes; also mirrored under `data/docs/` for notebook use).
- `VISUALIZING GLOBAL WIND PATTERNS (SciVis 2026 - Task 1).pdf` (contest brief) currently lives in `manifest/`; copy it here as well if you want a single references directory.
